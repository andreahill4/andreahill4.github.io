    <h1>Graffiti in New York City</h1>
    <body>
        <b>Graffiti in New York City</b> has had a substantial local, national, and international influence.
    </body>
    <h2>Growth of graffiti culture in New York</h2>
    <p>Graffiti began appearing around New York City with the words "Bird Lives"<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti_in_New_York_City#cite_note-1>[1]</a> but after that, it took about a decade and a half for graffiti to become noticeable in NYC. So, around 1970 or 1971, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAKI_183">TAKI 183</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_168"> Tracy 168 </a> started to gain notoriety for their frequent vandalism.[2] Using a naming convention in which they would add their street number to their nickname, they "bombed" a train with their work, letting the subway take it throughout the city.Bubble lettering was popular among perpetrators from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx"> the Bronx</a>, but was replaced with a new "wildstyle", a term coined by Tracy 168 and a legendary original Graffiti crew with over 500 members including Blade, Cope 2, T Kid 170, Cap, Juice 177, and Dan Plasma. Graffiti tags started to grow in style and size. Notable names from that time include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dondi_(graffiti_artist)"> DONDI</a>, Lady Pink, Zephyr, Julio 204, Stay High 149, PHASE 2.</p>
    <p>Graffiti was growing competitive and artists desired to see their names across the city.[3] Around 1974 suspects like Tracy 168, CLIFF 159 and BLADE ONE started to create works with more than just their names: they added illustrations, full of scenery and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartoon">cartoon</a> characters, to their tags, laying the groundwork for the mural-car.[3] The standards from the early 1970s continue to evolve, and the late 1970s and early 1980s saw new styles and ideas. As graffiti spread beyond <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Heights,_Manhattan">Washington heights</a> and the Bronx, a graffiti crime wave was born. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fab_Five_Freddy">Fab 5 Freddy</a> (Friendly Freddie, Fred Brathwaite) was one of the most notorious graffiti figures of that era. He notes how differences in spray technique and letters between Upper Manhattan and Brooklyn began to merge in the late 1970s: "out of that came 'Wild Style'." Fab 5 Freddy is often credited with helping to spread the influence of graffiti and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music">rap</a> music beyond its early foundations in the Bronx, and making links in the mostly white downtown art and music scenes. It was around this time that the established art world started becoming receptive to the graffiti culture for the first time since Hugo Martinez's Razor Gallery in the early 1970s.
        <p>The growth of graffiti in New York City was enabled by its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Subway">subway system</a>, whose accessibility and interconnectedness emboldened the movement, who now often operated through coordinated efforts. It was further left unchecked due to the budgetary restraints on New York City, which limited its ability to remove graffiti and perform transit maintenance. Mayor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lindsay">John Lindsay</a> declared the first war on graffiti in 1972, but it would be a while before the city was able and willing to dedicate enough resources to that problem to start impacting the growing subculture.
            <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Beame">Abraham Beame</a> Administration established a police squad of about 10 police officers to work in anti graffiti capacity. The squad attended informal meetings and socialized with minor suspects to gather information to help them apprehend leaders. Although the squad gathered information on thousands of graffiti vandals, inadequate manpower prevented them from following through with arrests. </p>
            <p>Graffiti vandal arrests in New York City were reported at around 4,500 between 1972 and 1974, 998 in 1976, 578 in 1977, 272 in 1978, 205 in 1979.</p>

    <h3>Decline of New York City graffiti subculture: enforcement and control</h3>
    <p>As graffiti became associated with crime, many demanded that the government take a more serious stance towards it, particularly after the popularization of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory">broken windows theory</a>. By the 1980s, increased police surveillance and implementation of increased security measures (razor wire, guard dogs) combined with continuous efforts to clean it up led to the weakening of New York's graffiti subculture. As a result of subways being harder to paint, more writers went into the streets, which is now, along with commuter trains and box cars, the most prevalent form of writing. But the streets became more dangerous due to the burgeoning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_epidemic_in_the_United_States">crack epedemic</a>, legislation was underway to make penalties for graffiti artists more severe, and restrictions on paint sale and display made obtaining materials difficult.
        <p>Many graffiti artists, however, chose to see the new problems as a challenge rather than a reason to quit. A downside to these challenges was that the artists became very territorial of good writing spots, and strength and unity in numbers (gangs) became increasingly important. This was stated to be the end for the casual subway graffiti artists.</p>
        <p>In 1984, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Transit_Authority">New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA)</a> began a five-year program to eradicate graffiti. The years between 1985 and 1989 became known as the "diehard" era. A last shot for the graffiti artists of this time was in the form of subway cars destined for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrecking_yard">scrap yard</a>. With the increased security, the culture had taken a step back. The previous elaborate "burners" on the outside of cars were now marred with simplistic marker tags which often soaked through the paint.
            <p>By mid-1986, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Transportation_Authority">Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA)</a> and the NYCTA were winning their "war on graffiti", with the last graffitied train removed from service in 1989. As the population of artists lowered so did the violence associated with graffiti crews and "bombing".  However, teenagers from inner London and other European cities with family and other links to New York City had by this time taken up some of the traditions of subway Graffiti and exported them home, although New York City writers like Brim, Bio, and Futura had themselves played a significant role in establishing such links when they visited London in the early-to-mid-1980s and "put up pieces" on or near the western ends of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_line">Metropolitan Line</a>, outside London.
